This service is using Angular, so run `ng serve` for a dev server. the server then runs on `localhost:4200`.

This Project uses Docker, 
To build the file execute the Dockerfile.

Alternatively you can run the Compose file, with `docker-compose up -d`
this will run this application on port `localhost:9000`.
